# Skin Type Recognition System

This project implements a **Skin Type Recognition System** that classifies skin types into three categories:

- **Oily**  
- **Normal**  
- **Dry**  

The system uses a **machine learning model** trained on relevant skin type data to predict the category based on input features.

## Next Steps

Our next planned feature is to create a **Recommendation Engine** that will:

- Suggest suitable **skincare products** based on your skin type.
- Provide **personalized skincare advice** using the predicted skin type.

> Note: This feature is currently an idea and has not been implemented yet.

## Features

- ML model for skin type classification.
- Easily extensible to integrate additional skin-related features.
- Future integration planned for personalized skincare recommendations.
